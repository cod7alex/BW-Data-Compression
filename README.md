# BW-Data-Compression

This repository contains implementation of compression based on Burrows-Wheeler transform (mostly known as the algorithm of bzip2 tool). 

It was implemented as a final project of "Algorithms" course that i took and main goal for it was to be simple and readable. It is not a complete and ready compression tool.

Things to improve:
1. Compress data in blocks of fixed size (this logic was skipped for simplicity)
2. Support binary files
3. ???
